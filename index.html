    <h3>Vinyl Cover Design</h3>
    <img src="PONY_FrontCover_Mockup.jpg" class="fullsize">
    <p> I created this album cover design for my Image Design course.
      The album is called Pony and it is by Rex Orange County. I picked this design
      because the album discusses themes of growth after a great deal of struggle.
      Thus, my illustration represnts growth happening even when you feel you are at your lowest.</p>

    <h3>Logo Design</h3>
    <img src="New1.13.22_Logo_Horizontal-05.png" class="fullsize">
    <p>This is a logo design done for Rivercity Ironwork. The owner wanted a logo design that
      represented the location of the company and what they provide. Thus, I went with a fleur de lis,
      which is a symbol commonly used in the St. Louis area, and combined it with a wrench, braided steel,
      and nuts.</p>

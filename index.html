    <h3>Vinyl Cover Design</h3>
    <img src="PONY_FrontCover_Mockup.jpg"
      width=600
      height=425/>
    <p> I created this album cover design for my Image Design course. The album is called Pony and it is by Rex Orange County. I picked this design because the album discusses themes of growth after a great deal of struggle. Thus, my illustration represnts growth happening even when you feel you are at your lowest.</p>
    <h3>Logo Design</h3>
    <img src="New1.13.22_Logo_Radial-02.png"
      width=1389
      height=1389/>
      <img src="New1.13.22_Logo_Horizontal-05.png"
        width=1667
        height=666.8/>
    <p>This is a logo design done for Rivercity Ironwork. The owner wanted a logo design that represented the location of the company and what they provide. Thus, I went with a fleur de lis, which is a symbol commonly used in the St. Louis area, and combined it with a wrench, braided steel, and nuts.</p>

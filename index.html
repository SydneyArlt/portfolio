    <p>This timeline was created for my Design Communication and Methodology class.
      The goal of this assignment was to create a timeline about a given topic,
      communism under Hitler and Stalin. I had to find similarities and differences
      between these two regimes and create a timeline that reflected them. This timeline was
      created using Illustrator. <p>

    <h2>Vinyl Cover Design</h2>
    <p> I created this album cover design for my Image Design course.
      The album is called Pony and it is by Rex Orange County. I picked this design
      because the album discusses themes of growth after a great deal of struggle.
      Thus, my illustration represnts growth happening even when you feel you are at your lowest.</p>

    <h2>Logo Design</h2>
    <p>This is a logo design done for Rivercity Ironwork. The owner wanted a logo design that
      represented the location of the company and what they provide. Thus, I went with a fleur de lis,
      which is a symbol commonly used in the St. Louis area, and combined it with a wrench, braided steel,
      and nuts.</p>
